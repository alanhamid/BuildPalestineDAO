            <p>Israel’s war on Gaza has exacted a devastating toll on civilians and intensified unrest in Lebanon and beyond. 
                A temporary ceasefire has finally brought a brief respite to Gaza after 15 months of relentless bombing, loss of life, and destruction. 
                During this fragile pause, hostages from Israel and Palestinian detainees have started to be released, offering a small measure of hope.</p>
                <p>By donating today, you can help people who have lost everything to this conflict. 
                    Your support will provide life-saving aid: emergency food, clean water, hygiene kits, and repairs to critical water and wastewater infrastructure in Gaza.
